            <p> Hello! My name is Bryan Jerger. I was born on Febuary 25th, 1989.
               I was born and live in Chicago, IL. I love to travel and play games.
               I have worked in the hobby gaming industry for almost 10 years and
               am looking to take the next step in my life in the tech industry.
            
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
               I was interested in technology for a very long time. I originally went
               to Depaul University for IT, but life sometimes doesn't lead you down the short path.
               Due to unforseen issues, I decided to take a break and work in retail at a hobby gaming store.
               After several years, I worked my way to manager and in-house IT specialist. I now control the store's
               website as well as all the IT needs.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
               It took several years, but now I want to work my way back into the technology field. I always like challenges
               and I feel this is the next step! 
            </p>
